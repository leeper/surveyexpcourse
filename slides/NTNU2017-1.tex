\frametitle{Experiments: Definition}

Oxford English Dictionary defines ``experiment'' as:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A scientific procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact
\item A course of action tentatively adopted without being sure of the outcome
\end{enumerate}
}

\frametitle{Experiments: History}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.75em
\item ``Experiments'' have a very long history

\item Major advances in design and analysis of experiments based on agricultural and later biostatistical research in the 19th century (Fisher, Neyman, Pearson, etc.)

\item First randomized, controlled trial (RCT) by Peirce and Jastrow in 1884

	\begin{itemize}
	\item<2-> First experiment by Gosnell (1924)
	\item<2-> Gerber and Green (2000) first major \textit{field} experiment

\item<2-> Statistical Solution
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Units are not identical
	\item Random exposure to a potential cause
	\item Effects measured on average across units

\end{enumerate}

\frame{
\frametitle{The Experimental Ideal}

\item It solves both the temporal ordering and confounding problems of observational causal inference
	\begin{itemize}
   		\item Treatment ($X$) is applied by the researcher before outcome ($Y$)
   		\item Randomization means there are no confounding ($Z$) variables

\frametitle{Neyman--Rubin Potential Outcomes Framework}

If we are interested in some outcome $Y$, then for every unit $i$, there are numerous ``potential outcomes'' $Y*$ only one of which is visible in a given reality. Comparisons of (partially unobservable) potential outcomes indicate causality.

}

\frame{

\frametitle{Neyman--Rubin Potential Outcomes Framework}

Concisely, we typically discuss two potential outcomes:

\begin{itemize}\small
\item $Y_{0i}$, the \textit{potential} outcome \textit{realized} if $X_i = 0$ (b/c $D_i = 0$, assigned to control)
\item $Y_{1i}$, the \textit{potential} outcome \textit{realized} if $X_i = 1$ (b/c $D_i = 1$, assigned to treatment)
\end{itemize}

}


\frame{

\frametitle{Historical Aside}

\small

\begin{itemize}
\item The history of the potential outcomes framework is contested
\item Most people attribute it to Donald Rubin
\item Paul Holland was the first to link to the philosophical discussions of causality
\item Donald Rubin attributes this to Jerzy Neyman (1923)
\item James Heckman denies all of this and attributes it Andrew Roy (1951)

On that test, the Patriot Act fails.

\item Major distinction between psychology tradition and economics tradition\footnote{Dickson, E. 2011. ``Economics versus Psychology Experiments.'' \textit{Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science}.}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Purpose of the study
	\item Purpose of specific items or tasks
	\item Order or length of questionnaire
	\end{itemize}
\item<2-> Psychologists focus on \textit{debriefing}

\item<3-> Publication bias (toward ``significant'' results) invites wasting resources on treatments that actually don't work
\end{itemize}
