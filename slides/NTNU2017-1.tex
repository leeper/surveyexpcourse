 			The observation of units after, and possibly before, a randomly assigned intervention in a controlled setting, which tests one or more precise causal expectations
 		\end{quote}

\item It solves both the temporal ordering and confounding problems of observational causal inference

   		\item Treatment ($X$) is applied by the researcher before outcome ($Y$)
   		\item Randomization means there are no confounding ($Z$) variables

\frametitle{Neyman-Rubin Potential Outcomes Framework}

If we are interested in some outcome $Y$, then for every unit $i$, there are numerous ``potential outcomes'' $Y*$ only one of which is visible in a given reality. Comparisons of (partially unobservable) potential outcomes indicate causality.

}

\frame{

\frametitle{Neyman-Rubin Potential Outcomes Framework}

Concisely, we typically discuss two potential outcomes:

\begin{itemize}\small
\item $Y_{0i}$, the \textit{potential} outcome \textit{realized} if $X_i = 0$ (b/c $D_i = 0$, assigned to control)
\item $Y_{1i}$, the \textit{potential} outcome \textit{realized} if $X_i = 1$ (b/c $D_i = 1$, assigned to treatment)
\end{itemize}

}


\frame{

\frametitle{Historical Aside}

\small

\begin{itemize}
\item The history of the potential outcomes framework is contested
\item Most people attribute it to Donald Rubin
\item Paul Holland was the first to link to the philosophical discussions of causality
\item Donald Rubin attributes this to Jerzy Neyman (1923)
\item James Heckman denies all of this and attributes it Andrew Roy (1951)

\item We typically talk about manipulations as directly setting the value of $X$, but in practice we are typically manipulating something \textit{that we think} strongly modifies $X$
\item<2-> Example: information manipulations aim to modify knowledge or beliefs, but are necessarily imperfect at doing so

\item<4-> Measure both what you wanted to manipulate \textit{and} what you didn't want to manipulate

	\item Study whether risk-related arguments about climate change increase support for a climate change policy

Now I'm going to read you three things that sometimes make people angry or upset. After I read all three, just tell me \textit{how many} of them upset you. I don't want to know which ones. just \textit{how many}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item the federal government increasing the tax on gasoline
\item professional athletes getting million-dollar salaries

A recent proposal \only<2>{\textbf{by the Taliban}} calls for the sweeping reform of the Afghan prison system, including the construction of new prisons in every district to help alleviate overcrowding in existing facilities. Though expensive, new programs for inmates would also be offered, and new judges and prosecutors would be trained. How do you feel about this proposal?

\frametitle{Look for TESS Examples}

In groups of 2--3, look through some TESS examples
\begin{itemize}
\item What was the researcher's question?
\item How did they test it experimentally?
\item What was interesting or surprising about the designs?
\end{itemize}

Take about 15 minutes.
