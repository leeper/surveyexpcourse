If we are interested in some outcome $Y$, then for every unit $i$, there are numerous ``potential outcomes'' $Y*$ only one of which is visible in a given reality. Comparisons of (partially unobservable) potential outcomes indicate causality.

Concisely, we typically discuss two potential outcomes:

\item $Y_{0i}$, the \textit{potential} outcome \textit{realized} if $X_i = 0$ (b/c $D_i = 0$, assigned to control)
\item $Y_{1i}$, the \textit{potential} outcome \textit{realized} if $X_i = 1$ (b/c $D_i = 1$, assigned to treatment)

	\item $\widehat{Var}(Y_0)$ is control group variance
	\item $\widehat{Var}(Y_1)$ is treatment group variance

Here are the two candidates who are running against each other: The first candidate is named \textbf{(caste name)} and is running as the \textbf{(BJP/SP/BSP)} party candidate. \textbf{(Corrupt/criminality allegation)}. His opponent is named \textbf{(caste name)} and is running as the \textbf{(BJP/SP/BSP)} party candidate. \textbf{(Opposite corrupt/criminality allegation)}. From this information, please indicate which candidate you would vote for in the \textbf{(village/state/national)} election.
