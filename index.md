# "Survey Experiments in Practice" Short Course

This page holds materials for a short course called "Survey Experiments in Practice", which I teach from time to time in various places. This course was first taught at the RECSM (Universitat Pompeu Fabra) Barcelona Summer School in Survey Methodology. Materials for the 2018 version of that course are below. 

## Overview

Survey experiments have emerged as one of the most powerful methodological tools in the social sciences. By combining experimental design that provides clear causal inference with the flexibility of the survey context as a site for behavioral research, survey experiments can be used in almost any field to study almost any question. Conducting survey experiments can appear fairly simple but doing them well is hard. 

This course will use published examples of experimental research to demonstrate a variety of ways to leverage survey experiments for testing social science theories. The course will teach participants how to use different survey experimental designs and how to address challenges related to sampling, survey mode, ethics, effect heterogeneity, and more. Students leave the course with a thorough understanding of how survey experiments can provide useful causal inferences, knowledge of how to design and analyze simple and complex experiments, and the ability to evaluate experimental research and apply these methods in their own research.

# UPF-RECSM Seminar, 2018

The next full iteration of this course will be taught at the [Barcelona Summer School in Survey Methodology](http://www.upf.edu/survey/Summer/) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. The short course involves two 4-hour sessions, scheduled to run from 14:00-18:00 each afternoon June 28-29, 2018. Slides, readings, and materials for each session of the course are available here.


## Syllabus and Schedule

An outline of the course is given below. All of the readings [are available here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwxjj0JIn0KoYkNIUXhtWFp5OTg).


### Session 1: Survey Experiments in Context (June 28, 14:00-16:00)

The first session will provide an overview of the course, discuss the history of survey experiments and experiments in general, and provide a conceptual and notational framework for design, analyzing, and discussing experiments.
