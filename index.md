# Materials for Survey Experiments short course #

This repository holds materials for a short course called "Survey Experiments in Practice" to be taught at the [Barcelona Summer School in Survey Methodology](http://www.upf.edu/survey/Summer/) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.

The short course involves five 2-hour sessions, tentatively scheduled to run from 9:00-11:00 each morning July 4-8, 2016. Slides, readings, and materials for each session of the course will be available here shortly.

## Overview ##

Survey experiments have emerged as one of the most powerful methodological tools in the social sciences. By combining experimental design that provides clear causal inference with the flexibility of the survey context as a site for behavioral research, survey experiments can be used in almost any field to study almost any question. Conducting survey experiments can appear fairly simple but doing them well is hard. This course will use published examples to demonstrate a variety of ways to leverage survey experiments and teach participants how to address challenges related to sampling, survey mode, ethics, and effect heterogeneity. Students leave the course with a thorough understanding of how survey experiments can provide useful causal inferences, knowledge of how to design and analyze simple and complex experiments, and the ability to evaluate experimental research and apply these methods in their own research.
