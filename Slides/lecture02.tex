\section{From Theory to Design}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsection]}
% deriving hypotheses from theory and manipulations from hypotheses


\frame{

\frametitle{Experiments are good at answering ``what if'' questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Forward causal questions
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Can X cause Y?
	\item What effects does X have?
	\end{itemize}
\item<2-> Backward causal questions
	\begin{itemize}
	\item What causes Y?
	\item How much of Y is attributable to X?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}



\frame{

\frametitle{What makes a good research question?}

KKV's two criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Politically important
\item Contribute to scientific understanding/literature
\vspace{0.5em}
\item<2-> Personally interesting
\item<2-> Unresolved
\item<3-> For experiments, forward in nature
\end{enumerate}
}

\frame{

Even though answering ``forward'' causal question, we start with an outcome concept.

\begin{itemize}
\item Term/label
\item Attributes (i.e., definition)
\item Indicators (i.e., operationalization)
\end{itemize}

% ACTIVITY

}


\frame{

We may have a "big" theory (like the effect of democratization on economic growth).

This isn't particularly well-suited to experimental intervention for various reasons (cost, ethics, finite population of countries, etc.), but there are possibly causal mechanisms or empirical implications that could be tested.

E.g., we can design an experiment where some citizens are invited to deliberate with authoritarian rulers on a local level (while a control group is not invited to participate) and then compare their economic productivity


}


\frame{

\frametitle{Hypotheses}


\begin{itemize}
\item From theory, we derive testable hypotheses
\item Hypotheses are expectations about differences in outcomes across levels of a putatively causal variable
\end{itemize}


% ACTIVITY

}


\frame{

\begin{itemize}
\item Derive experimental design from hypotheses
\item We can only test hypotheses by comparing two (or more) experimental conditions
\item Experimental ``factors'' are expressions of hypotheses as randomized groups
\item What intervention each group receives depends on hypotheses
	\begin{itemize}
	\item presence/absence
	\item levels/doses
	\item qualitative variations
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

}


% Talk about protocol and preregistration

\frame{

\frametitle{Protocol}

Protocol\footnote{Thomas J. Leeper. 2011. ``The Use of Protocol in the Design and Reporting of Experiments.'' \textit{The Experimental Political Scientist}.} is the complete planning document for how to design, implement, and analyze an experiment

It contains details of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Theory/hypotheses
\item Instrumentation
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Manipulation(s)
	\item Outcome(s)
	\item Covariate(s)
	\item Manipulation check(s)
	\end{itemize}
\item Sampling
\item Implementation
\item Analysis
\end{enumerate}
}

\frame{

\frametitle{Activity!}

\begin{itemize}
\item With a partner, identify each of the protocol elements of the experiment described by Kahneman and Tversky
\begin{enumerate}
\item Theory/hypotheses
\item Instrumentation
\item Sampling
\item Implementation
\item Analysis
\end{enumerate}
\item Report back in about 7 minutes
\end{itemize}

}


\subsection{Question Wording Designs}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsubsection]}

\frame{

\frametitle{Question Wording Designs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Kahneman and Tversky is ``question wording'' experiment
\item Hypothesized difference in outcomes according to the decision being faced
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Risky or not risky
	\item Gains or losses
	\end{itemize}
\item Manipulation operationalizes this by asking two different questions
\item Outcome is the answer to the question
\end{itemize}

}


\frame{

\frametitle{``Framing'' Experiments}

\begin{itemize}
\item Example: Schuldt et al. ```Global Warming' or `Climate Change'? Whether the Planet is Warming Depends on Question Wording.''

\end{itemize}
}

\frame{

\frametitle{Subtle Cue Experiments}

}

\frame{

\frametitle{Question testing}

Use question wording designs to select which survey measures we want to use

\begin{itemize}
\item Select possible question wordings
\item Select some criterion(-ia) for assessing which is better
\item Pilot test and then use the item that performs better
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assessing Treatments}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsubsection]}


% manipulation checks: Manipulation checks are a measurement of our manipulated variable
% pretesting

\frame{

\frametitle{How do we know we manipulated what we think we manipulated?}
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> Outcomes are affected consistent with theory
\item<3-> Before the study using \textit{pilot testing} (or \emph{pretesting})
\item<4-> During the study, using \emph{manipulation checks}
\item<5-> During the study, using \textit{non-equivalent outcomes}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{

\frametitle{I. Outcomes Affected}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tautological!
\item Doesn't tell us anything if we hypothesize null effects
\end{itemize}

}


\frame{

\frametitle{II. Pilot Testing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Like question wording, but assess whether a set of possible manipulations affect a measure of the \textit{independent} variable
\item<2-> Example:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Goal: Manipulate the ``strength'' of an argument
	\item Write several arguments
	\item Ask pilot test respondents to report how strong each one was
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

}

\frame{

\frametitle{III. Manipulation Checks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Measures added post-treatment, post-outcome that assess whether the \textit{independent} variable was affected by treatment
\item<2-> Example:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Goal: Manipulate whether respondent believes a policy is expensive or not
	\item Outcome is support for the policy
	\item Manipulation check comes after opinion question, asking how expensive the respondent believes policy is
	\item Compare beliefs in treatment and control conditions
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

}

\frame{

\frametitle{IV. Non-equivalent outcomes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Measures an outcome that \textit{should not} be affected by independent variable
\item<2-> Example:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

}


\subsection{Question Order Designs}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsubsection]}

\frame{

\frametitle{Question Order Designs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Manipulation comes in the order or set of questions before the outcome measure
\item<2-> Example:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Goal: assess influence of value salience on support for a policy
	\item Manipulate salience by asking different questions:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Battery of 5 ``individual liberties'' questions, or
		\item Battery of 5 ``life'' questions
		\end{itemize}
	\item Measure support for legalized abortion
	\end{itemize}
\item<3-> If answers to manipulated questions are important, can measure rest of battery post-outcome
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Surveys can be used as a measurement instrument for a field treatment
\item No manipulation in the survey itself
\item Survey only measures outcomes post-treatment

	\end{enumerate}
}
% history: stimultaneous alterntive cause
% maturation: time trends
% testing: measurement changes behavior
% instrumentation: operationalization changes over time
% instability: measurement error
% regression (to the mean):
% - statistically: extreme cases will be less extreme on second measurement
% - in policy terms: interventions are most likely when problems are extreme

% one more not mentioned by Campbell and Ross: If the series is an aggregation, it's also possibly due to attrition or changing composition of the sample from which the data is aggregated

		\item<2-> Use a comparison case (or cases)!

	\item Four subpopulations:
		\begin{itemize}\small
		\item Compliers: $X = 1$ only if $W = 1$
