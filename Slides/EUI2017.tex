If we are interested in some outcome $Y$, then for every unit $i$, there are numerous ``potential outcomes'' $Y*$ only one of which is visible in a given reality. Comparisons of (partially unobservable) potential outcomes indicate causality.

}

\frame{

\frametitle{Neyman-Rubin Potential Outcomes Framework}

Concisely, we typically discuss two potential outcomes:

\begin{itemize}\small
\item $Y_{0i}$, the \textit{potential} outcome \textit{realized} if $X_i = 0$ (b/c $D_i = 0$, assigned to control)
\item $Y_{1i}$, the \textit{potential} outcome \textit{realized} if $X_i = 1$ (b/c $D_i = 1$, assigned to treatment)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The history of the potential outcomes framework is contested
\item Most people attribute it to Donald Rubin

Minimum detectable effect is the smallest effect we could detect given sample size, ``true'' effect size, variance of outcome, power, and $\alpha$.\\

\vspace{0.5em}

In essence: some non-zero effect sizes are not detectable by a study of a given sample size.\footnote{Gelman, A. and Weakliem, D. 2009. ``Of Beauty, Sex and Power.'' \textit{American Scientist} 97(4): 310--16}

With the passage of the Patriot Act in 2001, the FBI can now enter your home, search around, and doesn't ever have to tell you it was there. You could be perfectly innocent, yet federal agents can go through your most personal effects. When considering new laws, a test of the impact on liberty should be required. On that test, the Patriot Act fails. At a massive 342 pages, it potentially violates at least six of the ten original amendments known as the Bill of Rights --- the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Amendments --- and possibly the Thirteenth and Fourteenth as well.
